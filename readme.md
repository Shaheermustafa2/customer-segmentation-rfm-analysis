### **Customer Segmentation \& RFM Analysis**


**Project Overview**
---

This project performs customer segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to identify high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers. The analysis was conducted using PostgreSQL and visualized in Power BI to support data-driven customer retention strategies.



#### **Business Objective**

To segment customers based on purchasing behavior and identify:

* High-value customers
* Loyal customers
* At-risk customers
* Revenue concentration patterns



#### **Tools \& Technologies**

* PostgreSQL (SQL)
* Power BI
* Excel (Data validation)



#### **Dataset**

Superstore transactional dataset containing:

* Customer Name
* Order Date
* Sales
* Profit
* Order ID



#### **RFM Methodology**

* Recency:
  Days since last purchase (calculated using dataset max date)
* Frequency:
  Total number of orders per customer
* Monetary:
  Total revenue generated by customer
* Customers were classified into business segments using scoring logic.

#### **Key Insights**

* Majority of customers fall under the High Value segment.
* Revenue is concentrated among a subset of customers.
* Low proportion of at-risk customers indicates strong retention.



#### **Business Impact**

This analysis enables targeted retention strategies, revenue optimization, and customer prioritization.
